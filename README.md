# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
The goal of the company Seoul Bike is providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes. It becomes a major concern to keep user satisfied. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count rents at each hour for a stable supply of rental bikes. We can suppose that this study could be reported to the company 'Seoul Bikes'. We think it could help them knowing if yes or not they have to supply bikes stations in the city, in order to keep a good satisfaction of the customers.


**Conclusion**-

1. The Rented Bike Count has been increased from 2017 to 2018.
2. No overfitting is seen.
3. XGBoost Regressor gives the highest R2 score of 96.6% for the Train Set and 89.4% for the Test set.
4. Feature Importance values for Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and XGBoost are different.

**Challenges**-

    • Needs to plot a lot of graphs to analyse.
    • Carefully handled the Feature selection part as it affects the R2 score.
    • Carefully tuned Hyperparameters as it affects the R2 score.
